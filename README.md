Agebot is a Discord bot written in Javascript using Discord.js.
It's intent is to serve as a Game Master's and Players assistant when running an RPG game with the [**Adventure Game Engine**](https://greenroninstore.com/collections/age-system) on a Discord server.

Functionalities (implemented as-is, no checks, possibly insecure and will break if you sneeze at it):

|Command|Description|STATUS|
|-|-|-|
|`/roll`|standard `3d6` roll. Automatically checks for **doubles** and checks **Stunt Points**.|![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/working-green)
|`/char`|generates a random character following the scheme outlined in the Basic Rulebook.|![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/WIP-orange)

More *definitely* to come...
